        <p>Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://25--5-clock.freecodecamp.rocks.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>User Story #1: I can see an element with id="break-label" that contains a string (e.g. "Break Length").</li>
            <li>User Story #2: I can see an element with id="session-label" that contains a string (e.g. "Session Length").</li>
            <li>User Story #3: I can see two clickable elements with corresponding IDs: id="break-decrement" and id="session-decrement".</li>
            <li>User Story #4: Within each .drum-pad, there should be an HTML5 audio element which has a src attribute pointing to an audio clip, a class name of clip, and an id corresponding to the inner text of its parent .drum-pad (e.g. id="Q", id="W", id="E" etc.).</li>
            <li>User Story #5: When I click on a .drum-pad element, the audio clip contained in its child audio element should be triggered.</li>
            <li>User Story #6: When I press the trigger key associated with each .drum-pad, the audio clip contained in its child audio element should be triggered (e.g. pressing the Q key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string Q, pressing the W key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string W, etc.).</li>
            <li>User Story #7: When a .drum-pad is triggered, a string describing the associated audio clip is displayed as the inner text of the #display element (each string must be unique).</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Here are some audio samples you can use for your drum machine</h3>
          <h3>Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.</h3>
          <h3>Note: Twitter does not allow links to be loaded in an iframe. Try using the target="_blank" or target="_top" attribute on the #tweet-quote element if your tweet won't load. target="_top" will replace the current tab so make sure your work is saved.</h3>
